## A Comprehensive Study Plan
Learn to code in Python ([Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)).

Study the needed mathematical foundations (Linear Algebra, Probabilities, Statistics), Khan Academy tracks will be sufficient.

Traditional NLP, although it’s not very widely used nowadays, but it covers some important concepts and techniques that you’ll need later ([Jurafsky & Manning course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQiyVNMpDLKnZYBTUOlSI9mi9wAErFtFm)).

Classical Machine Learning ([Andrew Ng class on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), solve [the assignments using Python](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)).

Deep Learning ([Andrew Ng specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera).

NLP with Deep Learning ([Stanford CS224n class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z&fbclid=IwAR1R3-VyCBrF1hCZGrhOmk24XMjGkHe27U8wMDp8oQ6XPViWd1DzEgH4Qp4)).

### Support Courses
